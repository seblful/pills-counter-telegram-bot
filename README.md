This GitHub repository contains code for a Telegram bot that uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to count the number of pills in an image and classify them as either capsules or tablets. The bot takes an image as input and returns a labeled image with the total count of pills.

The YOLO v8 model is a state-of-the-art object detection model that can accurately detect and classify objects in images. The model has been trained on a large dataset of pill images, allowing it to accurately classify different types of pills.

The Telegram bot is built using Python and the Telegram Bot API. It uses the YOLO v8 model to process images and return the count and classification of pills.

Users can simply upload an image to the Telegram bot, and the bot will process the image and return the total count of pills, along with a labeled image highlighting each pill and its classification. This makes it easy for users to quickly and accurately count and classify pills, which can be useful in a variety of settings.

Overall, this GitHub repository provides a powerful tool for pill counting and classification using the YOLOv8 model and a Telegram bot.
